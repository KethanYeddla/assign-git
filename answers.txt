Gitignore file is a text file in the project where we keep the files and folders which we tell not to track.
.mtj.tmp/
*.class
*.jar
*.war
*.ear
*.nar
hs_err_pid* 

The tip of your main branch is moved forward to the end of your feature branch using fast-forward merges. This cleanly integrates your feature branch back into your main branch while maintaining the sequential order of all contributions made there.

Each developer can separate their work from other developers' efforts by branching out from the original code base.

Usually we have a single Git remote repository
